            <p class="dear"> Dear reader,</p>
            <div>
               <p class="para1"> My story began over 10 years ago. I studied journalism, during my final year of university I started a blog. I fell in love with the design and development aspect of it. I would spend more time working on the blog's look than actual journalism work. </p>
               <p>After graduation, the blog I created was doing well. It received awards from major magazines and people were actually reading it. </p>
               <p>Everything seemed so unreal.</p>
               <p>However, a year after, I got unwell, my mental health was deteriorating and I gave up on the work I had spent almost two years creating.</p>
               <p>Everything fell apart, I didn't know how to pick myself up again. </p>
               <p>A few years after my first psychotic episode, I finally found the motivation to move forward again. I wanted to work with young kids. I wanted to change lives.</p>
               <p>I studied to become a teacher. This is when my thoughts started wandering. What if, in the future I open a coding school for young children? This thought has remained with me ever since. It has become my life goal.</p>
               <p>So, if you are wondering why I want to become a developer? My motivation is my love for coding and my reason is to make my dream a reality. </p>
               <p>(Below I have shared a video that explores the importance of coding)</p>
               <p> Yours,</p>
               <p>Nila</p>
